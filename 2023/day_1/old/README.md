Task:
    Read in an undefined looooong list of strings containing characters and numbers, and then take a two digit number from each string. The two digit number comprises of the first digit that appears in the string and the last digit that appears in the string. Then, sum all these two digit numbers to find the answer.

First time ever trying to make a python script. They're pretty freeform with how you can find the answer, since all they did was dump the inputs on the website and asked for the answer.

First thoughts were to write it in through an input file. Because I thought to do something like that, I ended up writing the output to a file too, although there was no real reason to. 

Final file works, and gets the output, so it does feel good to not really have to put in a lot of effort with python and get a desirable outcome, but like. I definitely didn't learn much about python. And compared to doing a complete and thorough learning of the language, I feel like I won't learn very much at all, because I really won't appreciate what the differences are between python and C.  

Ultimately, just googled my way through most of the challenge, and didn't really do much more than getting my feet wet with python and vscode. The only skill I had from before was the computational thinking from CS1010. Definitely doesn't feel like I had a real direction, and probably didn't follow best practices, so my code probably looks like some stitched mishmash of StackOverflow.
